Networking Fundamentals

This directory is filled with the basic concepts on computer networking. Here, we will be diving into how devices are networked together and how they communicate with one another. I have learned the following:
  1. Client/Server model, network topologies, and how DNS function and its vulnerabilities
  2. OSI models: its various vulnerabilities and what each layer represents.
  3. Utilizing wireshark to visualize and analyze the previously stated network concepts
  4. Performing SYN scans and learning more about layers 2-4 on the OSI model.
